# Product Sense Problems
## Diagnose A Problem
### Framework

1. Clarify the scenario/metric
2. Time - Sudden or stable (progressively)?
	- Internal: Data source? Data collection? Bug?
	- External: Seasonality? Industry trend? Competitors? Special event? Natural disaster?
3. Other product/feature by the company?
	- Have we made any change to our product line?
	- Have other related products experienced the same change?
4. Segment by user demographic and behavioral features
	- Regions
	- Languages
	- Platforms, i.e. IOS, Android, Web
5. Decompose the metric (optional)
	- E.g. Daily Active User (DAU)
	= Existing Users + New Users + Resurrected Users - Churned Users
6. Summarize the overall approach
	- Most reasonable causes
	- How to fix

## Measure Success
### Framework

1. Clarify the function/goal of this product/feature
	- What it does? How is it used? Who is it for?
	- Very important!!!
2. Define the metrics (no more than 3)
	- 2 **Success metrics** to measure the success. E.g. daily active users, number of bookkings, and conversion rate
	- 1 **Guardrail metric**, should not degrade in pursuit of a new product/feature. E.g. cancellation rate, and bounce rate
	- Good metrics should fit the **context**

## Diagnose A Problem
- How to test a product idea
- Whether to launch a product/feature

1. Clarify goals and define metrics
	- Similar to measure success
2. Experimentation
	- How to design?
	- How to split the users?
	- How long to run it?
3. Recommendation based on experiment results
	- Linl the results to the goal and bussiness impact. E.g. what does 0.01% lift in conversion rate translate to revenue?
	- Conflicting results. E.g. increase DAU but also increase in bounce rate?
	- Short-term v.s. long-term. E.g. launch brings in more users thus benefits outweight drawbacks

## Tips

Before the interview

1. Search for the company and product
	- know the product better; think about the metrics for the specific product

During the interview

1. Always clarify the question - high-level goal
2. Write down thought process with bullet points
