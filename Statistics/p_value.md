# P-value and Significance Test

## P-value

- **Definition**: Probability of obtaining a real-valued test statistic at least as extreme as the one actually obtained.

## Significance Test


Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

## Type I and II Error

- Type I error ($\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true, i.e., false positive rate. 
- Type II error ($\beta$) is the probability of not rejecting $H_0$ when $H_a$ is true (or $H_0$ is false), i.e., false negative rate. 

$\alpha$ is also referred to as ‘significance level’. 

[Note: R.A. Fisher and all others before J. Neyman and E. Pearson did not use an explicit alternative or talk of error rates. P-values can be defined and used without either concept.]
