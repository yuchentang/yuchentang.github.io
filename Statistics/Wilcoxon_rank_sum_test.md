# Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests

Test Assumptions
When running a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, the basic assumptions are random sampling from each of the two
populations and that the measurement scale is at least ordinal. These assumptions are sufficient for testing
whether the two populations are different. If we can additionally assume that the two populations are identical
except possible for a difference in location, then this test can be used as a test of equal means or medians.
